Using andromeda scan with the help of python and nmap assigned ip looking for open tcp and udp ports.

REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE ANDROMEDA:

Have python in its version 3

Have nmap installed, otherwise the install script will not work

NECESSARY FACILITIES IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THEM:

sudo apt install nmap

pip install python-nmap (THIS IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THE SCRIPT WORK)

RUNNING SYSTEMS:

UBUNTU 20.04 LTS RUNNING KALI LINUX  RUNNING TERMUX IS NOT WORKING AT THE MOMENT

SCRIPT EXECUTION:

python3 Andromeda.py

chmod +x Andromeda.py

for this version the menu system was added as well as the option to scan the local network. Other things to keep in mind is that more modifications are expected to be added in the future to better adapt to the older version of Andromeda that will not be supported.
